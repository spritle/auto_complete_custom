Step1: Configure database.yml
Step2: Run migration script <b>rake db:migrate</b> (I already added some dummy data for testing)
Step3: Start the server
step4: Go to http://localhost:3000/user and try to enter some characters in company name text field.
The auto suggest should pop-in and upon selecting, it should fill the relative details.

Thanks.
